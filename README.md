# ReadingIsGood

ReadingIsGood is a simple online books web api application. API, Domain and Infrastructure layers form the project. API layer is the presentation layer and gives knowledge about the interaction with domain layer. Domain layer is the layer which keeps the data modeling, database models, configurations and service interfaces. Infrastructure layer can be considered as the implementation layer. All the core services are implemented in this layer.

SwaggerUI,
Microsoft Buit-In Dependency Injection,

The project can be runned with creating a database named ReadingIsGoodDB at MongoDB. I added the SwaggerUI test results images.
